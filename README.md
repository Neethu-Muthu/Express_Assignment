# Async Await Practice Questions
This README file provides a summary of the practice questions for learning  async/await in JavaScript and Node.js. The questions are designed to help you understand how to handle asynchronous operations, manage timeouts, simulate delays, and make HTTP requests using async/await.
## Fetch Data with Timeout
- Write a JavaScript function that fetches data from an API and cancels the request if it takes longer than a specified time.
 ## Process Array with Delay
 
- Write a Node.js program that processes an array of numbers. The program should double each number in the array but with a simulated delay of 1 second for each number using async and await.

## Fetch Data from URLs

Create an async function that reads a list of URLs from an array, fetches data from each URL, and logs the response times for each request.

## Retry Mechanism

- Implement a retry mechanism in an async function that fetches data from a URL. The function should retry up to 3 times before throwing an error.

## Fetch Data using Axios

- Find out the difference between Axios and fetch. Rewrite a program to get the data from real-time API services using Axios.

## Filter Posts

- Write an async function that fetches data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. Then filter the posts to only include those with userId equal to 1 and log the titles of these posts.

## Multiple Requests in Parallel

- Implement an async function that makes multiple requests in parallel using an array of URLs. Once all requests are complete, find the request that took the longest time to complete and log its URL and duration.

## Usage
These questions are designed for practicing async/await functionality. To use these questions:

- Create a new JavaScript or Node.js project.
- Implement each question in a separate file or function.
- Test your implementations thoroughly to ensure they handle asynchronous operations correctly.
